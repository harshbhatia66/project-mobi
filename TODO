In workout sessions model we only want one workout template:
http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/workout_sessions/
Not a list:
{
    "workout_template": [
        "This field is required."
    ]
}

# Go through all the variable names and correctly rename any plurals and '_ids'

When an session exercise has sets for an exercise, update the exercise logs to have a 'previous' kg and reps
