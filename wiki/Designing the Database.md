- **User**: Represents the app users.

- **Exercise**: Represents individual exercises.
- **Set**: Represents a set within an exercise.
- **Reps**: Represents the number of repetitions in a set.
- **UserProgress**: Tracks the progress of the user over time.

### 2. Define Attributes for Each Entity

#### User
- ID (Primary Key)

- Other personal details (age, gender, fitness goals, etc.)

#### Workout

- Type (e.g., strength, cardio)
- Notes

#### Exercise
- Exercise ID (Primary Key)
- Name
- Description
- Type (e.g., weightlifting, cardio)
- Recommended Reps/Sets

#### Set
- Set ID (Primary Key)
- Workout ID (Foreign Key)
- Exercise ID (Foreign Key)
- Reps
- Weight
- Duration (for time-based exercises)
- Notes

#### UserProgress
- Progress ID (Primary Key)
- User ID (Foreign Key)

### 3. Establish Relationships

- A **User** can have multiple **Workouts**.
- A **Workout** can include multiple **Exercises**.
- An **Exercise** can have multiple **Sets**.
- **UserProgress** is associated with a **User**.

### 4. Additional Metadata

- metadata to your tables, like timestamps (created_at, updated_at) to track when records are created or modified.

### 5. Data Types and Constraints

- Assign appropriate data types to each attribute (e.g., VARCHAR for strings, INT for integers).
- Add constraints where necessary, like NOT NULL or UNIQUE, to ensure data integrity.

### 6. Diagram Your Schema

- Create a visual representation of your schema. Tools like dbdiagram.io or Lucidchart can be helpful. This will give you a clear overview of your database structure and relationships.
